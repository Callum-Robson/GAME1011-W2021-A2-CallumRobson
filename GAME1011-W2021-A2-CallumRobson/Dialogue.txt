You awake in a small room.
There is a chest near the west wall, and a door on the north wall.
What do you want to do?@

You open the chest and find a sword and a key.@

You turn the handle but the door is locked.@

You unlock the door and proceed to the next room.@

You've already looted this chest.@

You walk into another room. 
There are three coloured buttons, a red one on the west wall, a blue one on the east wall, and a green one on the floor in the center of the room.
There is a door on the north wall with no keyhole. 
Hopefully it's not locked.@
