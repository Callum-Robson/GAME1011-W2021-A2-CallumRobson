You awake in a small room.
There is a chest near the west wall, and a door on the north wall.
Which direction to you want to move?@
You open the chest and find a sword and a key.
Which direction to you want to move?@
You turn the handle but the door is locked.
Which direction to you want to move?@
You unlock the door and proceed to the next room.
You walk into another room. 
There are three coloured buttons, a red one on the west wall, a blue one on the east wall,
and a green one on the floor in the center of the room.
There is a door on the north wall but no obvious way to open it.
Hopefully it's not locked.
Which direction to you want to move?@
You've already looted this chest.
Which direction to you want to move?@
There's nothing of interest here.
Which direction to you want to move?@
You walk through the open door and proceed to the next room.
You enter a new room. There is an open door on the north wall,
and a chasm separating the north and south sides of the room.
You could try to jump over it but it doesn't look like you'll make it.
On the south side of the chasm near the west wall is a big scary monster.
Which direction to you want to move?@
The door is still shut.
Which direction to you want to move?@
You push the red button down, it remains depressed.
Which direction to you want to move?@
You push the blue button down, it remains depressed.
Which direction to you want to move?@
You push the green button down, it remains depressed.
Which direction to you want to move?@
This button is still depressed.
Which direction to you want to move?@
The buttons all rise, nothing else happens.
Which direction to you want to move?@
You hear mechanical noises and the door slowly rises into the wall.
Which direction to you want to move?@
You run towards the chasm and jump from the very edge...
you fall to your death.@
You kill the monster using the sword you found earlier.
It falls to the ground, behind it you see a button which you press.
A bridge appears over the chasm, you walk across and leave the dungeon, happily ever after, goodbye.
